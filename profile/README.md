## 🙋‍♀️ Who We Are
We’re a team dedicated to seeing to the all-round growth of music ministers 
and advancing the kingdom of heaven through music. We believe that every minister must have character, anointing and skill.    
Our flagship event — the **Music Ministers' Conference** — brings together music ministers for 3 days of worship, learning, and community.
